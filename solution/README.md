Both Sync and Async solution uses a generic min heap with proxies to help easier compare and access the stored records

## Solution Analysis
Let there be N number of sources, each with 1~M number of records
## Sync Solution
- Time Complexity: O(NMlogN)
- Space Complexity: O(N)
## Async Solution
Solution can be as simple as the Sync solution with the switch of `pop` to `popAsync` but if we pop one by one it causes us to wait for a long time.
Ex. 100 records with ~20000 records total with each pop having ~4ms delay means we have to wait at least ~80 seconds!
In order to save time, `popAsync` can be called on all N sources and try to print more than one record at a time.
To preserve order we call more of `popAsync` on each specific resoure if the result is still older than the current second oldest record.
By using `PRINT_RATIO=0.2` we print 20% of what is in min heap so the heap doesn't get filled with results returned from `popAsync` calls.
- Time Complexity: O(NMlogN)
- Space Complexity: O(NM) -- Actual size is dependent on how much is printed out between tasks so this number shouldn't be reached

<p>
With this growth rate, having 1 mil sources would cause the task to take 3~hrs!
Thatâ€™s without any of the networking delay that may happen if some of the sources are remote.
